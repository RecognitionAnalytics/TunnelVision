In this situation I would like to present you YATE. 

Yate is based on project Document.Editor from: https://documenteditor.codeplex.com/.
Instead of using HTMLToXMLConverter,the Yate convert direct to FlowDocument. Old conversion doesn't support many features from HTML (like other size types, color types , etc..). 

This is not and never will be full HTML conversion to FlowDocument but it helps to work with this type of input.

In this control you can:

* Paste HTML input from clipboard with formatting, images, tables like in WebBrowser.

* Automatically recognize URL
* Paste Images, by one command.
* Resizing Images

* Good looking Toolbar with MahApps.Metro style.
